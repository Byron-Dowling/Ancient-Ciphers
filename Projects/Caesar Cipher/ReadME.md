## Caesar Cipher
### Byron Dowling
### Description:

***Sophomore level project, have not revisited to improve***
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who, according to Suetonius, used it with a shift of three (A becoming D when encrypting, and D becoming A when decrypting) to protect messages of military significance. While Caesar's was the first recorded use of this scheme, other substitution ciphers are known to have been used earlier.

### Instructions

- The program can be run from your machine's console or from this replit project: https://replit.com/@ByronDowling/DSP3#main.cpp
- The program expects an input file and output file destination
- Additionally, this program does not sovle every Ceasar Cipher, although this is not diffcult to modify, the orignal goal was to shift the text based off the assumption that with E being the most common letter, whatever the frequency analysis revealed as the top letter should be shifted to E. 
- After shifting the text this way, the program will ask the user to answer if the text decrypted successfully or not and writes the results to a file.
